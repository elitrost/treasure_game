For this project we were asked to create an intelligent agent for a Treasure Hunt game. The objective of this agent was to find the treasure before the human player. In order to create this agent, we were asked to develop a deep Q-learning algorithm which would train the intelligent agent. We were given code that represented the maze environment in which the maze object was defined as a matrix and code which stored the episodes. The code which stored the episodes was used by the agent for exploitation.

As this course comes to a finish, I have gained a greater understanding of the creation of artificial intelligence, ethical issues that may arise, and enhanced problem-solving skills. Entering the computer science field, I understand the impact of newly created technologies and the importance of social awareness. Applications are needed to continue the growth of our society but more importantly need to be created with limited to no biases in order to create a more just society. As a computer scientist every problem must be be first examined and then simplified to produce a clear solution (algorithm). It is critical for these solutions to these problems to be continually reevaluated in order to ensure modern best practices and the absence of bias.
